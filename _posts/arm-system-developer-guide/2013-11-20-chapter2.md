#chapter2
##1.REGISTERS
> There are 18 active registers:16 data registers and 2 processor status registers.r0~r15 are visible to programmer.However,r13,r14 and r15 has special function.

![the assigned special-purpose registers:]() 

- r13 is used as the stack pointer(sp) and stores the head of the stack in current processor mode
- r14 is called the link register(lr) and is where the core puts the return address 
- r15 is the program counter(pc)and contains the address of the next
- instruction to the be fetched by the processor.

> There arm two program status register:cpsr and spsr(the current and saved program status registers,respectively)                
> which registers are visible the program depend on the current mode of the processor.               


###2.CURRENT PROGRAM STATUS REGISTER
![psr-registers](/picture/arm1.png "psr-picture")
> the cpsr is divided into four fields:flags,status,extension,and contorl
the extension and status fields arm reserved for future use.the contorl fields
contains the processor mode,state,and interrupt mask bits.the flags fields contains the condition flags.


####2.1 PROCESSOR MODES
> There are seven processor modes in total:six privileged modes(abort,fast interrupt request,interrupt request,supervisor,system,and undefined) and one 
> onnprivileged mode(user)

- __abort mode__:there is a failed attempt ro access memory.
- __Fast interrupt request__ and __interrupt request__ mode:correspond to the two interrupt levels available on the arm processor.
- __supervisor mode__:the mode that the processor is in after reset and is genernally the mode that an operating system kernel operats in.
- __system mode__:special version of __user mode__ that allows full read-write access to cpsr
- __user mode__:the mode is used for programs and application

####2.2 BANKED REGISTER
> the figure show below are all 37 registers.of those,20 registers are hidden from a program at differnt 
> times.these registers are called  banked registers.they are only available when the processor is in *particular mode*

![complete-arm-registers](/picture/arm2.png "complete-arm-registerse")

> cpsr is not copied into the spsr when a mode change is forced due to a program writing directly to the cpsr.The cpsr
> only occurs when an exception or interrupt is raised.

####2.3 INTERRUPT MASKS

__interrupt masks are used to stop specific interrupt requests from interrupting the processor.__

The *cpsr* two interrupt masks bits,7 and 6,or`I and F`,which control the masking of IRQ and FIQ.The I bit masks IRQ when set to binary 1,and similarly the F bit masks FIQ when set to binary 1.

####2.4 CONDITION FLAGS
__Condition flags are updated by comparisons and the result of ALU operations that specify the S instruction suffix.__

##2.PIPLINE

__A pipeline is the mechanism a RISC processor uses to execute instructions.__

##3.EXCEPTIONS,INTERRUPTS,AND THE VECTOR TABLE

> The memory map address 0x00000000 is reserveda for the vector table,a set of 32-bit words.On some processor the vector table can be optionally located at a higher address in memory(starting at the offset 0xffff0000).such as linux and microsoft's embeded products an take advantage of this feature.

![the-vector-table](/picture/arm7.png "the-vector-table")

- __Reset vector__ is the location of the first instruction executed by the processor when power is applied.this instruction branches to initialization code.
- __Undefined instruction vector__ is used when the processor cannot decode an instruction.
- __Software interrupt vector__ is called when you execute a SWI instruction.The SWI instruction is frequently used as the mechanism to invoke an operating system routine.
- __Prefetch abort vector__ occurs when the processor attempts to fetch an instruction from an address without the correct access permissions.The actual abort occurs in the decode stage.
- __Data abort vector__ is similar to prefetch abort but is raised when an instruction attempts to access data memory without the correct access permissions.
- __Interrupt request vector__ is used by external hardware to interrupt the normal execution flow of the processor.It can only be raised if IRQs are not masked in the cpsr.
- __Fast interrupt request vector__ is similar to the interrupt request but is reserved for hardware requiring faster response times.It can only be raised if FIQs are not masked in the cpsr.

##4.CORE EXTENSION

###4.1 CACHE AND TIGHTLY COUPLED MEMORY
__The cache is a block of fast memory placed between main memory and the core.It allows for more efficient fetched from some memory types.__

__There are two types cache of arm:__
- Von Neumann-style core
- Harvard-style core

###4.2 MEMORY MANAGEMENT
__ARM cores have three differnt types of memory management hardware:__

- __Nonprotected memory__ is fixed and provides very little flexibility.It is normally used for small.simple embeded systems that requrie no protection from rogue applications.
- __MPUs__ employ a simple system that uses a limited number of memory regions.These regions  are controlled with a set of special corocessor registers,and each region is defined with specific access permissions.This type of memory management is used for systems that require memory protection but don't have a complex memory map.The MPU is explained in chapter13.
- __MMUs__ are the most comprehensive memory management hardware available on the ARM.The MMU uses a set of translation tables to privide fine graimed control over memory.These tables are stored in main memory and provides a virtual-to-physical address map as well as access permissions.MMUs are designed for more sophisticated platform operating system that support mutitasking.The MMU is explained in chapter14.

###4.2 COPROCESSORS
__Coprocessors can be attached to the ARM processor.A coprocessor extends the processing feature of a core by extending the instruction set or by providing configuration registers.More than one coprocessor can be added to the ARM core via the coprocessor interface.__
